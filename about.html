        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Yes- Hello, Heyo! They call me Jin
            My name's Jin Fitz. I like drawing, music, photography, video making, and more. I made this website originally in the summer between my junior and senior year of high school, and shall be updating it as I grow.
            I was born in Chongqing China, and was adopted and taken to the United States when I was just a 2 year old baby. As a senior in high school, I was apart of the e-Communication, 21st century academy for Entertainment Video Production. I am currently in college working towards my Bachelors in Science - Digital Media; Visual Imaging. I think doing illustration, graphic design or commercial videography / photography in my future would be what I'd like to do, as well as for-fun content making on social media as a hobby, and perhaps even starting my own small business with my art work.â€‹
            Along with digital media, I've always loved music. I have a small collection of instruments that I keep. I've played violin since 5th grade, and have been practicing guitar, ukulele, and kalimba on and off just for fun! Seeing old worn and used instruments, thinking of the music they once made. I've always loved seeing people create music and and be so passionate about it. It always excites me when I see someone who can make really good music and song pieces, those who can just come up with a melody out of nothing, or those who can share their deepest experiences through lyrics and sound, it's truly inspiring. Eventually I'd like to take on electric guitar, bass guitar, and maybe even drumbs.
            I've been exposed to the world of photography since I was young, a family friend was doing photography with my mother has a hobby, so I grew up with the exposure to photo and video taking. When a great friend introduced me to his photography, I got really into the art of photo taking and editing, and realized my love for using cameras. Taking film photos and scanning them myself is also a fun way for me to switch up my photography and make it into something special and different. I have a small collection of film cameras I randomly find from various thrift shops I find while I travel, and find interest in trying them out and seeing how they compare to other cameras, and how the different film looks.
            One day I'd like to travel around and see what the world has to offer. Some bucket list places are most certainly, China, Canada, Japan, Italy, Brighton, Ireland, and many more!
            What I think truly sparked my passion for art and creativity was when my cousin showed me this game on my iPad mini, called Minecraft. My love for Minecraft then introduced me into the world of artwork, youtubers, video games, and showed me this new world filled with passionate people who just love making and creating different things!
